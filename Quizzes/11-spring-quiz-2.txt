Question 1, max points = 15

True or false?

_____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.
_____: Relations in a domain model are typically represented as 
				attributes in a UML class diagram.				
_____: Attributes are the preferred way of modelling relations in an
				UML class diagram.
_____: Attributes in UML class diagrams are typically represented
				as methods in object-oriented source code.
_____: Android software development is only possible in the Eclipse IDE.
										 
										 
Question 2, max points = 40 (20+10+10)

You are designing a system that manages software development teams. 
You have identified four important groups of stakeholders: 
project managers, developers, architects, and testers. 
(a) Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that contains a single 
class. This class will represent all stakeholders. Now add to the diagram
additional elements to represent project managers, developers, architects, 
and testers and the way they are related to the stakeholder class.







(b) Now convert your domain model to Java code. Outline the Java class 
or interface definitions in such a way that an architect cannot be a 
developer and vice versa.







(c) Now do another Java code outline in which a developer may also be an
architect and vice versa.









Question 3, max points = 45 (15+30)

Consider the puzzle method in class C below.

public class C {
	public int f; // field

  public static int puzzle(A a, int i) {
																// <-- add assertion here
    if (a.f == i)
			return 42;   
    return 0;
   }
}

(a) For certain input values, the body of the puzzle method may throw a 
runtime exception. Add an assertion at the beginning of the method body 
that detects and prevents all such runtime exceptions. 
Use the following template:
       if (bad condition) return -1;

(b) After adding your assertion, fill out the following table, similar
to the Pex slides presented in class.
