true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 15 * 4 = 60

True or false?


_____: "Set" and "tuple" are synonyms.
_____: A relation is a set of tuples.
_____: A binary relation is a set of pairs.
_____: If a graph has nodes {A, B, C} and contains an edge that originates
				at node A and terminates at node A then the graph's edges cannot be 
				represented truthfully as a binary relation on the graph's nodes.
_____: If a graph has nodes {A, B, C} and contains two edges that originate
				at node A and terminate at node B then the graph's edges cannot be 
				represented truthfully as a binary relation on the graph's nodes.
_____: The goal of creating a domain model is to capture all elements in the
				customer's domain.
_____: Using attributes in UML class diagrams is the preferred way of 
				capturing relations in the customer's domain.
_____: A UML class diagram is a graph that can contain two edges that 
				originate at a node A and terminate at a node B (where A and B are
				different nodes).
_____: If a UML class diagram has 5 nodes then it must have at least 
				5 edges.
_____: A relation in a domain model represents a relation variable, i.e.,
				during program execution the content of the relation may change.
_____: A multiplicity constraint in a UML class diagram captures the
				constraint that the two sets participating in the constrained 
				relation have exactly the given numbers of elements.				
_____: A multiplicity constraint in a UML class diagram captures the
				constraint that the two sets participating in the constrained 
				relation have at least the given numbers of elements.
_____: If B is a subclass of A, C is a subclass of B, and A has attribute T 
				then C inherits T.
_____: If B is a subclass of A, C is a subclass of B, and A has a relation
				with D, then C inherits this relation.
_____: Code reviews are an interesting research topic but are not done in 
				practice.
