Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

____: Code reviews are an interesting research topic but are not done in 
			industrial software engineering.
____: A best practice is to quantify the extent to which each requirement must
			be met.
____: Usability requirements cannot be made testable.			
____: For each pair of sets (A,B) in a given domain model, there can be more 
			than one relation between A and B in the domain model.
____: For each pair of classes (A,B) in a given UML class diagram, there can be
			more than one association (line) between A and B in the class diagram.
____: The domain models discussed in class can be explained in terms of sets, 
			relations, and constraints on sets and relations.
____: When designing a domain model as a UML class diagram, we can express the 
			constraint that "each element of X shall also be an element of a subset 
			of X" directly in the domain model. But we cannot express such a 
			constraint in Java, when translating the domain model to Java code.
____: A relation in a domain model represents a relation variable, i.e.,
			during program execution the content of the relation may change.
____: Assume that in a domain model "Cash Pay" is a subtype (subset) of "Pay". 
			The domain model defines a relationship between Pay and Client. This 
			means that Cash Pay inherits this relationship.
____: In a domain model that is expressed as a UML class diagram each box must
			have a direct connection (line) to at least two other boxes.
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
Question 2, max points = 10 + 15 + 10 + 15 = 50

(a) While designing university administration software, you have identified 
three groups of stakeholders: professors ("Prof"), administrators ("Admin"), 
and students ("Student"). Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that 
initially contains a single box. This box will represent all stakeholders. Then
add to the diagram additional elements to represent professors, administrators, 
students and the way they are related to the stakeholder box. In your domain 
model, reflect the given constraint C1 that these three groups of stakeholders 
shall not overlap (e.g., no professor can also be a student).









(b) Now convert your domain model to object-oriented source code. State the 
object-oriented language you are using in your answer (e.g., "Java").










(c) Now draw another domain model as a UML class diagram. In the new model, 
retain the three distinct groups of stakeholders. But this model should allow a 
member of one group to also be a member of one or both of the other groups. In 
other words, your new domain model should not follow constraint C1 but otherwise
be identical to (a).








(d) Now convert your new domain model to object-oriented source code. Use the 
same object-oriented language as in (b).
