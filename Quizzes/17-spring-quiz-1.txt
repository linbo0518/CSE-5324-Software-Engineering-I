			have an author listed, you do not need to cite it as a source.

			the study have not been published, but you get permission to use the 
			results in your paper. You still have to cite the source.					
____: Copying a sentence from a web site into your slides, written 
			deliverables, or homework solution is always plagiarism.

			should not be part of the project.
