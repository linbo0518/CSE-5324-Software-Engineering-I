Question 2, max points = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

(a) Draw a UML communication diagram that involves the following:
- One call to a method named a.
- One call to a method named b.
- One call to a method named c.
Design the diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two different
Java implementations of the methods a, b, and c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.










(b) Give an outline of the first implementation in Java-style pseudo code 
(where: a calls c).










(c) Give an outline of the second implementation in Java-style pseudo code
(where: b calls c).










(d) Now draw a new UML communication diagram that is similar to the previous 
one, except that the new diagram has additional elements to clarify that 
b calls c.
