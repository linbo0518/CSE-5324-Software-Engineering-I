Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

_____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.
_____: An operation contract defines the pre- and post-conditions of a
				step in a use-case scenario.
_____: Operation contracts are part of the design (they are not part
				of the requirements).
_____: Operation contracts are not directly related to the domain model.
_____: Operation contracts must be expressed in first-order logic.
_____: UML packages can only be used in UML package diagrams.
_____: Name-spaces are typically organized in a tree-structure.
_____: Name-spaces allow one to reuse the same simple name for 
				different elements.
_____: The Apache Ant build management tool presented in class is rarely
				used in Java development projects.				
_____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
				software design because it includes all the information that is
				contained in the dynamic design models.
_____: A guard in a sequence diagram enables the guarded method call 
				to proceed under any circumstances.
_____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
				items as the corresponding box in a domain model.
_____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
				items as the corresponding box in a sequence diagram.
_____: An advantage of UML sequence diagrams over UML communication
				diagrams is that they are more compact.
_____: Guards in communication diagrams are stronger than guards in 
				sequence diagrams.
_____: The Rational Rose modeling tool presented in class is open source
				software and freely available to all students of CSE 5324.				
_____: Relations in a domain model are typically represented as 
				operations in a UML class diagram.
_____: Operations in a UML class diagram are typically represented as 
				methods in object-oriented source code.
_____: Multiplicity constraints are important in a domain model but they
				cannot influence the resulting source code.
_____: Android software development is only possible in the Eclipse IDE.



Question 2, max points = 20

You are designing a system that manages software development teams. 
You have identified three important groups of stakeholders: 
project managers, developers, and testers. Draw a domain model as a UML 
class diagram that contains a single class. This class will represent
all stakeholders. Now add to the diagram additional elements to represent 
project managers, developers, and testers and the way they are related to 
the stakeholder class.





Now convert your domain model to Java code. I.e., outline the Java class 
or interface definitions that ensure that a tester cannot be a developer 
and vice versa.





Now do another Java code outline, in which a developer may also be a
tester.





Question 3, max points = 20

Draw a UML sequence diagram that involves the following:
- One call to a method named a.
- One call to a method named b.
- One call to a method named c.
Design the diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two different
Java implementations of the methods a, b, and c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.
Give an outline of the two different implementations.
