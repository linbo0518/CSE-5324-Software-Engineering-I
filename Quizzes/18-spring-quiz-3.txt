Question 1, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

____: A relation is a set of tuples.
____: Domain models can be explained in terms of sets, relations, and 
			constraints on sets and relations.
____: The UML class diagram domain model shows each relation as an attribute
			of a class (box).
____: The method described in class maps each domain model relation to an
			instance field (where we model an instance field as a Mathematical 
			function).
____: A m:n relation in the domain model (which is not a function) cannot be 
			implemented as an instance field.			
____: For each pair of classes (A,B) in a UML class diagram, there can be more 
			than one line (association) between A and B.
____: For each class C in a UML class diagram, there can be a line (association) 
			from C to C.
____: In a UML class diagram a type such as a class can have several supertypes.
____: In a UML class diagram a subtype inherits the associations of all of its 
			supertypes.
____: One goal of creating a system sequence diagram is to identify the public 
			API of the software system.	
			
			
			
			
			

			

			
			
			
			
			



			
Question 2, max points = 15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 50

You are designing a system that manages a library. You have identified the 
following kinds of library items: books, periodicals, and DVDs.

(a) Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that contains a single type. 
This type will represent all library items. Now add to the diagram additional 
elements to represent books, periodicals, and DVDs and the way they are related 
to the item type. Enforce in your class diagram that each item is either a 
book, a periodical, or a DVD.










(b) Now convert your domain model to Java code skeletons.









(c) A few days later you realize that your library will also have to manage a 
variety of other library items that are similar to books, periodicals, and 
DVDs, but do not fit any of these three kinds. You plan to make a single change 
to your UML class diagram to allow for any such items. Draw an updated version 
of your UML class diagram domain model.










(d) Convert your updated domain model to Java code skeletons.
