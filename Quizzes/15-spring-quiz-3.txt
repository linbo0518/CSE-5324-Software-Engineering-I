Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 15 * 3 = 45

True or false?

____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
			object-oriented program.
____: An operation contract defines the pre- and post-conditions of a step in a 
			use-case scenario.
____: Operation contracts are not directly related to the domain model.
____: Operation contracts must be expressed in first-order logic.
____: UML packages cannot be used in UML class diagrams.
____: In our context of UML and Java, name-spaces are typically organized in a 
			non-tree graph-structure.
____: Name-spaces allow one to reuse the same simple name for different 
			elements.
____: The dynamic design models are the most important element of a software 
			design because they also include all the information that is contained in 
			the static design models.
____: A guard in a sequence diagram prevents execution of the guarded method 
			call to proceed under any circumstances.
____: A m:n relation in the domain model can be mapped to a primitive field in 
			object-oriented code (e.g., an int field in Java).			
____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of items as 
			the corresponding box in a domain model.
____: An advantage of UML communication diagrams over UML sequence diagrams is 
			that they show more code structure.
____: Guards in sequence diagrams are stronger than guards in communication 
			diagrams.
____: Relations in a domain model are typically represented as operations in a 
			UML class diagram.
____: Operations in a UML class diagram are typically represented as fields in 
			object-oriented source code (e.g., Java).



Question 2, max points = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

You are designing a central university administration software. You have 
identified three important groups of stakeholders: professors (prof),
administrators (admin), and students. Draw a domain model as a UML class 
diagram that initially contains a single box. This box will represent all 
stakeholders. Now add to the diagram additional elements to represent 
professors, administrators, students and the way they are related to the 
stakeholder box.







Now convert your domain model to Java code. I.e., outline the Java code 
constructs that ensure that an administrator cannot be a professor and vice 
versa.







Now do another Java code outline, in which an administrator may also be a
professor.







Question 3, max points = 10 + 15 = 25

Draw a UML sequence diagram that involves 3 elements: one call to a method 
named a, one call to a method named b, and one call to a method named c. Design 
the diagram such that it can be mapped to two different Java implementations of 
the methods a, b, and c. In the first implementation, a calls c. In the second 
implementation, b calls c.




Give an outline of the two different implementations.
