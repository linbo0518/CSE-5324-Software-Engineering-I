Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

_____: The design class diagram is considered a static design model.
_____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
				software design because it includes all the information that is
				contained in the dynamic design models.	
_____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.			
_____: The relations (associations) depicted in the domain model cannot 
				be represented in the design class diagram.
_____: A 1:1 relation in the domain model may be implemented in a design
				class diagram as an attribute.
_____: A 1:1 relation in the domain model may be implemented in code
				as an instance field.
_____: A relation that is not a function cannot be represented in a
				design class diagram.
_____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in code.
_____: The UML concept of "realization" is unrelated to the UML concept
				of "generalization"
_____: The core message of Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract is that
				you should not start the design before the client has paid the 
				fee defined in the contract.
_____: Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract concepts are only useful for
				people who code in his Eiffel programming language.
_____: Sub-contracting in Design by Contract means that a sub-contractor
				may place additional requirements on the client.
_____: Method overriding can be explained as sub-contracting.
_____: Method overloading is best explained as sub-contracting.

_____: The average speed of a code review was 150 lines of code per hour.

Question 2, max points = 30

You are designing a system that manages sports teams. You have identified
two important concepts: players and games. We also know that each player 
plays in up to n games and each game is played by at least m players.
Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that represents these two 
concepts and the "plays" relation between them. 





Now convert the domain model into a design class diagram. Take into account
that, in the code, we will need to navigate from a game to the 
participating players, but not the other way around.





Now convert the design class diagram into Java classes. You may limit
your answer to a minimal outline that just represents the concepts 
discussed above.





Question 3, max points = 10

In the sense of Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract, the following 
class B may act as a sub-contractor of class A. If B is a bad
sub-contractor of A, B may break a contract of A. Show two separate
ways how B may break a contract of A. Phrase your explanation in
terms of foo's pre- and post-conditions.

public class B extends A {
	public int foo(int p) {..}
}
