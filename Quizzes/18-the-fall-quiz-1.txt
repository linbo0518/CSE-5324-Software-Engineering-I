____: Since Wikipedia articles do not have an author listed and can be edited 
			by anyone, you do not need to cite them as a source when copying text 
			from a Wikipedia article into your slides.
____: Copying a sentence from a web site into your project report is always 
			plagiarism, no matter what else you do.
____: You insert into your slides an image you found on the web. Adding a slide 
			titled "References" at the end and listing the web site there is enough to 
			avoid plagiarism.			
____: A core task of the reviewers in a Fagan inspection is to provide detailed 
			improvement suggestions as part of their review.			
____: Fagan inspections are most cost-effective if they are only performed at 
			the end of a project.			
____: While Fagan inspections are valuable for finding problems in software 
			artifacts, Fagan inspections cannot be applied to non-software artifacts
			such as college-level grade rubrics.			
____: A best practice for Fagan inspections is for the manager to count how
			many problems reviewers find in each programmer's code and reduce each
			programmer's annual pay merit increase by the number of problems 
			reviewers found.
____: Every software development project faces risks.
____: A key technique for mitigating budget risks in a software development 
			project is to remove as many requirements from the project as possible.
____: A key technique for mitigating a software development team's risk of 
			developing the wrong functionality is to get as much feedback from 
			customers and users as frequently as possible.
____: Key techniques for mitigating the risk of requirements volatility when 
			developing an object-oriented application include making all object 
			fields private by default and accessing each class via interfaces.
____:	If an architecture document describes features that are not part of the 
			project requirements then this is not considered a problem, as the 
			customer will get additional features and everyone will be happy.
____: In a software project, a good vision statement excludes things that 
			should not be part of the project.
____: In software engineering, a project team X should share its vision 
			statement with the engineers who review X's software artifacts.
____: Mock screenshots (UI prototypes) created with pencil and paper can be a 
			better choice in a software development project than UI prototypes 
			created with dedicated prototyping software.


Question 2 (max points = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40)

(a) Briefly describe the two biggest concrete risks your team project is
currently facing (up to 1 sentence each).










(b) For the two risks you identified in (a), compute each risk's risk exposure. 
Give each risk's effect E and risk exposure RE in terms of the number of extra 
hours your team would have to spend in total if the risk became a reality. 










(c) Justify your choices of E and RE briefly (one sentence each).










(d) Briefly describe your plan for mitigating each of the risks you identified 
in (a), (up to 2 sentences each).
