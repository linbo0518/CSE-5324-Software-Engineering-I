Example Question: True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1: True or false? (max points = 10 * 5 = 50)

____: "After spending 5 minutes on the app's built-in training material, 
			80% of users shall be able to complete a purchase order within the app 
			within 5 minutes" is easier to test than "the app should be very
			user-friendly".
____: The notion of "operation contract" we covered in class specifically
			targets the medical domain, to establish a contract before a medical
			operation.
____: A domain model in the UML class diagram notation we used in class may 
			contain a single box X plus the three associations A, B, and C, where 
			each association connects X with itself.			
____: With the domain model notation we covered in class we can constrain a
			relation in a domain model to be a function.
____: With the domain model notation we covered in class we can constrain a
			given relation R on sets A and B in a domain model such that R 
			satisfies the following two conditions. Condition 1: R relates each 
			element in A to exactly one element in B. Condition 2: R relates each 
			element in B to exactly one element in A.			
____: With the domain model notation we covered in class we can constrain a
			given relation Q on sets A and B in a domain model such that Q 
			satisfies the following two conditions. Condition 1: Q relates each 
			element in A to exactly two elements in B. Condition 2: Q relates each 
			element in B to exactly one element in A.
____: The fact that a domain model relation contains a certain tuple is
			a valid operation contract post-condition.
____: The fact that set M in the domain model contains a certain element is a 
			valid operation contract post-condition.			
____: Given some relation S on sets A and B in an app's domain model, a step in 
			a use case scenario of the app can temporarily "relax" S's multiplicity 
			constraint of "each element in A is related to exactly one element in B 
			and vice versa", by relating each element in A to an arbitrary number 
			of elements in B and vice versa.
____: Given some relation T on sets A and B in an app's domain model, a step in 
			a use case scenario of the app can temporarily "tighten" T's multiplicity 
			constraint of "each element in A is related to an arbitrary number of 
			elements in B and vice versa", by relating each element in A to exactly 
			one element in B and vice versa.
			
			


Question 2, max points = 10 + 15 + 15 + 10 = 50

You are designing an app that can manage a professional basketball franchise 
(NBA or WNBA). You have determined that your app has to keep track of the 
following groups of people: players, trainers, and (back-office) workers.

(a) For this basketball franchise scenario, draw a first version of your domain 
model as a UML class diagram that contains a single element. For now this 
element will represent the set of all people the app keeps track of.




(b) Now you want to create a refined domain model that contains additional 
elements to represent the players as one set of people, trainers as another, 
and (back-office) workers as another. Now the domain model should make it clear 
that there can be no overlap between these three sets (e.g., a player cannot be 
a trainer). Also the domain model should retain the element from (a), to make 
clear that each of the three sets (players, trainers, workers) is a subset of 
all the people the app keeps track of. Draw the new model below.










(c) Now convert your domain model to code skeletons in an object-oriented 
language (e.g., Java, C#, or C++). Recall that in our methodology each set 
item (e.g., each player) becomes an instance (an object) in an object-oriented
app. Document your choice of language. Your code skeletons should retain all 
the constraints from (b).












(d) Briefly (two sentences) describe how your language choice in (c) has 
influenced how your solution in (c) enforces the constraint from (b), i.e., no 
overlap between the three sets of people (e.g., a player cannot be a trainer).
