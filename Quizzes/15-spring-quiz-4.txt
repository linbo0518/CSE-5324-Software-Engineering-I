Question 1, max points = 15 * 4 = 60

True or false?

public class C 					 { 	public int foo(C p) { return 1; } }
public class D extends C { 	public int foo(C p) { return 2; }
														public int foo(D p) { return 3; } }
public class E extends D { 	public int foo(E p) { return 4; }	}
class X { /*..*/ C c = new C(); C d = new D(); C e = new E(); }

____: d.foo(c) == 1
____: d.foo(d) == 2
____: d.foo(e) == 3
____: e.foo(d) == 3
____: e.foo(e) == 4

____: According to the GRASP principles, a best practice in Java applications
			is to use "instanceof" expressions.
____: According to the GRASP principles, a best practice in Java applications
			is to use bloated controllers.
____: If an object-oriented application consists of many classes then the 
			optimal coupling between these classes is zero.
____: If an object-oriented application has high coupling then its classes are
			guaranteed to also have high cohesion.
____: If the classes of an object-oriented application have high cohesion then
			the application is guaranteed to also have high coupling.

____: In method overloading, foo(E) is more specific than foo(C).
____: In method overloading, foo(C,int) is more specific than foo(C).
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense 
			for a language to allow co-variant type change for method parameters.
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense
