Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.



Question 1, max points = 5 * 5 = 25

Fill in each of the below ____ with the value returned by the method call 
given after the == operator.
				
public class C 					 { 	public int foo(C p) { return 1; } 
														public int foo(E p) { return 2; } }
public class D extends C { 	public int foo(C p) { return 3; }
														public int foo(D p) { return 4; } }
public class E extends D {	public int foo(E p) { return 5; } }
/* .. */ 
C d = new D(); 
C e = new E(); 
D f = new E();
____ == e.foo(d)
____ == d.foo(e)
____ == d.foo(f)
____ == f.foo(e)
____ == f.foo(f)


Question 2, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

____: The goal of the "cohesion" GRASP pattern is to maximize cohesion.
____: Java programs can contain kinds of coupling that are not possible in 
			C programs.
____: A given design pattern is always best implemented using the same 
			language constructs in all object-oriented programming languages 
			(Java, C++, etc.)
____: Moving a set S of classes from using implementation inheritance to
			using composition can reduce coupling within S.
____: If class Dog extends class Animal then a future (different) version 
			of the Animal class can break the code in Dog.
____: In Design by Contract sub-contracting a sub-contractor may place 
			additional requirements on the clients of the original contractor.
____: In Design by Contract sub-contracting the pre-condition of the
			original contractor must imply the pre-condition of the			
			sub-contractor.
____: In Design by Contract sub-contracting the post-condition of the
			sub-contractor must imply the post-condition of the original 
			contractor.
____: If class B extends class A, then, in the sense of method overloading,
			method foo(A,B,B) is more specific than method foo(B,A,A).
____: If class B extends class A, then, in the sense of method overloading,
			method foo(B,B) is more specific than method foo(A).
