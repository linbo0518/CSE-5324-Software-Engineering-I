true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

____: Operation contracts can be used to describe state changes in the domain 
			model sets and relations.
____: The fact that a domain model relation does not contain a certain tuple is 
			a valid operation contract post-condition.
____: A name-space is typically organized in a tree-structure.
____: When structuring elements via name-spaces, one can assign the same simple
			name to many different elements.
____: Information hiding means that we should hide int values by storing them 
			as floating point numbers.
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in Java code.
____: A 1:N relation in the domain model may be implemented in code as an 
			instance field.
____: A M:N relation in the domain model may be implemented in code as an 
			instance field.			
____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
			items as the corresponding box in a domain model.
____: In an object-oriented program, an instance field can be understood as
			a map (a mathematical function) from instance values to field values.
	
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
Question 2, max points = 25 + 25 = 50

(a) For this question assume object-oriented terminology, e.g., as found in the
context of Java, C#, or C++. Draw a single UML sequence diagram that contains 
one call each to the three methods a, b, and c, where class X defines a and 
class Y defines c. Design your sequence diagram such that it can be mapped to 
two different implementations:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.














(b) Give an outline of the two different implementations. That is, show the
code outline of the involved classes and methods in an object-oriented language
of your choice. Clearly state the language you are using.
