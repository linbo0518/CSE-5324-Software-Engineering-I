Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 5 * 5 = 25

Fill in each of the below ____ with the value returned by the method call 
given after the == operator.
				
public class C 					 { 	public int foo(C p) { return 5; } }
public class D extends C { 	public int foo(C p) { return 4; }
														public int foo(D p) { return 3; } }
public class E extends D {	public int foo(E p) { return 2; } }
/* .. */ 
C d = new D(); 
C e = new E(); 
D f = new E();
____ == f.foo(e)
____ == f.foo(d)
____ == e.foo(e)
____ == e.foo(d)
____ == d.foo(d)



Question 2, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

____: The goal of the "coupling" GRASP pattern is to maximize coupling.
____: For a given class C in an object-oriented program, if half of C's 
			instructions focus on updating domain model relations and the other half 
			focus on retrieving elements from the database, then we can say C has low 
			cohesion.
____: Java programs can contain kinds of coupling that are not possible in 
			C programs.
____: The maintainability of object-oriented code can be improved by replacing
			"instanceof" expressions with subtype polymorphism.
____: Design-by-Contract means that software developers have to sign a legal
			contract for each code unit they implement.
____: Design-by-Contract is an academic idea that to date has been ignored
			by major software companies such as Microsoft.
____: In Design-by-Contract, the preconditions P of a method M are useful
			in the development of both the body of M and the callers of M.
____: In Design-by-Contract, the postconditions Q of a method M are useful
			in the development of both the body of M and the callers of M.
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense
			for a language to allow co-variant type change for method return values.
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense
			for a language to allow co-variant type change for method parameters.
			
				
Question 3, max points = 15 + 10 = 25

(a) Give the code of a textbook singleton class in an object-oriented language
such as Java. You may use pseudo-code, but state the programming language for
which you are giving the code.





















(b) Describe scenarios for which your above code does not maintain the 
singleton property. Alternatively, explain how your code prevents common
problems related to maintaining the singleton property, from which other 
textbook singleton code versions suffer.
