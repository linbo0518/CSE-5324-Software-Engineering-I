Question 1, max points = 5 * 5 = 25

Fill in each of the five blanks (____) below with the value returned by the
method call that is given after the == operator.
				
public class C 					 { 	public int foo(C p) { return 1; } }
public class D extends C { 	public int foo(C p) { return 2; }
														public int foo(E p) { return 3; } }
public class E extends D {	public int foo(C p) { return 4; }
														public int foo(E p) { return 5; } }
/* .. */ 
C x = new D(); 
C y = new E(); 
D z = new E();
____ == y.foo(x)
____ == x.foo(y)
____ == x.foo(z)

			overloading, method foo(B,X) is more specific than method foo(A,X).
____: If interface B extends interface A, then, in the sense of method 
			overloading, method foo(B,X) is more specific than method foo(A,X).
____: Java programs can contain kinds of coupling that are not possible in
