Example Question: True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1: True or false? (max points = 10 * 5 = 50)

____: The notion of "operation contract" we covered in class specifically
			targets the medical domain, to establish a contract before a medical
			procedure.
____: With the domain model notation we covered in class we can constrain a
			given relation in a domain model to be a function.
____: The fact that a domain model relation does not contain a certain tuple is
			a valid operation contract pre-condition.
____: The fact that a domain model relation does not contain a certain tuple is
			a valid operation contract post-condition.
____: An operation contract post-condition can relax a multiplicity constraint
			of relation R in the domain model from "R is a function" to "R may be an
			arbitrary relation".
____: An operation contract post-condition can restrict a given relation S in 
			the domain model from "S is an arbitrary relation" to "S is a function".			
____: A name-space is typically organized in a tree-structure.
____: When structuring elements via a name-space, two of these elements can 
			have the same fully qualified name.
____: When structuring elements via a name-space, two of these elements can 
			have the same simple name.			
____: When structuring a set of elements {A, B, C, ..} via a name-space, 
			elements A and B may have the same simple name X. At the same time, the
			parent of A and the parent of B may also have the same simple name X.			
			




			
			
			
			
			
			



			
			
			
			
Question 2, max points = 15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 50

You are designing a system that manages a library. You have identified the 
following kinds of library items: books, periodicals, and DVDs.

(a) Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that contains a single type. 
This type will represent all library items. Now add to the diagram additional 
elements to represent books, periodicals, and DVDs and the way they are related 
to the item type. Enforce in your class diagram that each item is either a 
book, a periodical, or a DVD.










(b) Now convert your domain model to Java code skeletons.









(c) A few days later you realize that your library will also have to manage a 
variety of other library items that are similar to books, periodicals, and 
DVDs, but do not fit any of these three kinds. You plan to make a single change 
to your UML class diagram to allow for any such items. Draw an updated version 
of your UML class diagram domain model.










(d) Convert your updated domain model to Java code skeletons.
