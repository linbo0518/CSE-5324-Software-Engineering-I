Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

_____: Software development tools such as source control systems are of
				great academic interest, but they are not used in practice.
_____: A software bug can lead to a financial loss of USD 500 million.
_____: The cost of fixing a bug is independent from the points in time at 
				which the bug was introduced into and removed from the software.
_____: The waterfall model is a classic software development process model.
_____: The waterfall model aims at producing code before all requirements 
				are fully analyzed.
_____: The waterfall model is often described as "iterative".
_____: A typical customer in software engineering is comfortable expressing
        requirements rigorously, e.g., in first-order logic.
_____: The goal of iterative software development is to first fully design the 
				software and to then iterate between coding and testing.
_____: It has been scientifically proven that, for small to medium projects, 
				iterative software development always leads to better results
				than the waterfall model.
_____: In large industrial software engineering, requirements are typically 
				fixed early on in the project and remain fixed.
_____: We can easily prove that a requirements document is sound and complete
				with respect to the wishes of the user.
_____: Using the sound/complete classification, if the user wishes A, B, C,
				a specification that consists of A, B, C, D is sound.				
_____: Using the sound/complete classification, if the user wishes A, B, C,
				a specification that consists of B is sound.
_____: Using the sound/complete classification, if the user wishes A, B, C,
				a specification that consists of A, B, C, D, E is complete.
_____: A use-case model often contains more information than the
				corresponding use-case diagram.
_____: A good use case is one that is short, about one paragraph of text.
_____: Domain models can be explained in terms of sets, relations, and 
				constraints on sets and relations.
_____: Each class in a class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.
_____: In hindsight, the main reason for the success of UML is that UML had
				a rigorous definition early on.
_____: The UML authors are disappointed with the use of UML as they expected
				that entire programs would routinely be generated from UML diagrams.

This is an open-ended question. Provide as much information as you
can within the time limit. Pick one use-case of your team project and
develop it here.
