Question 1, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

The first question is almost verbatim from the plagiarism homework.

____: Since Wikipedia articles do not have an author listed and can be edited 
			by anyone, you do not need to cite them as a source when copying text 
			from a Wikipedia article into your slides.
____: Copying a sentence from a web site into your slides, written 
			deliverables, or homework solution is always plagiarism.
____: You insert into your class presentation an image you found on the web. 
			Adding a slide titled "References" at the end of your presentation and 
			listing the web site there is enough to avoid plagiarism.
____: Fagan inspections and reviews have in common that the reviewers' primary
			goal is identifying problems in the reviewed documents.
____: In industrial software engineering, a best practice is that Fagan 
			inspections and reviews	should only be performed once the team has 
			started coding.
____: While checklists are widely used in other industries such as health care,
			they are of little practical value in software engineering, since 
			software engineering differs significantly from other engineering 
			disciplines.
____:	Software engineering tools such as build tools and test automation 
			frameworks are of academic interest but of little practical value in
			industrial software engineering.
____: In a software project, a good vision statement excludes things that 
			should not be part of the project.
____: In a software project, a good vision statement should not be shared with
			personnel outside the immediate project team.
____: To be useful in a software project, mock screenshots must be created with
			sophisticated prototyping tools.
