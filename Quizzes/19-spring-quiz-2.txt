CSE 3311, Spring 2019, Quiz 2


Example Question: True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1: True or false? (max points = 15 * 4 = 60)

____: Joel's hallway usability testing (of the "Joel Test") requires a hallway.
____: Joel's hallway usability testing is a fast way to get feedback on the 
			software you are developing.
____: According to the Joel Test, a good way to reduce a programmer's 
			productivity is to frequently chat with the programmer (e.g., every 15 
			minutes).
____: According to the Joel Test, the most productive work environment for 
			programmers is a large open floor plan office, where programmers both 
			sit close to and frequently interact with many non-programmers.
____: A common synonym for the waterfall model is "iterative".			
____: In an iterative process, the first few iterations do not produce any 
			code.
____: On average, the larger the software development project, the higher is 
			the percentage of requirements that will change during the project.			
____: Dealing with requirement changes is on average easier with iterative 
			software development than it is with waterfall-style software development.
____: In iterative software development, "time-boxed" iterations mean that 
			management frequently shortens the duration of individual iterations, 
			while increasing the duration of other iterations, to respond to project 
			needs.
____: Creating UML diagrams is only cost-effective when done in a UML modelling
			tool.
____: Each extension of use-case U answers a "what if" question about U's main 
			success scenario.
____: An extension of use-case U may consist of more steps than U's main 
			success scenario.
____: A best practice for making it easy to check if a software system S meets 
			a given requirement R is to quantify R.
____: Assume requirement R1 is "S has to respond immediately" and requirement 
			R2 is "S has to respond within one hour". Checking if S satisfies R2 is 
			easier than checking if S satisfies R1.				
____: Some requirements, such as usability, are by their nature "hopeless" and
			therefore hard to achieve, as they cannot be made testable.
			







Question 2, max points = 40

This is an open-ended question. Provide as much information as you can within 
the time limit. Pick one use-case of your team project and develop it here.
