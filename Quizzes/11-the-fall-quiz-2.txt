Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 15 * 4 = 60

True or false?

_____: Domain models can be explained in terms of sets, relations, and 
				constraints on sets and relations.
_____: A relation is a set of tuples.
_____: A function is a set of tuples.
_____: A domain model can only be expressed with a UML class diagram.				
_____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.
_____: Relations in a domain model are typically represented as 
				attributes in a UML class diagram.				
_____: For each pair of classes (A,B) in a UML class diagram, there can
				be more than one line (association) from A to B.
_____: For each pair of sets (A,B) in a domain model, there can
				be more than one relation between A and B.
_____: For each class C in a UML class diagram, there can be a line
				(association) from C to C.
_____: N-ary relations with N>2 are rare in UML.
_____: If we express a domain model as a UML class diagram, we can
				express that one set is a subset of another set.
_____: If we express a domain model as a UML class diagram, we cannot
				express that two subsets do not overlap.
_____: The UML class diagram constraint "each element of set A also has 
				to be an element of a subset of A" cannot be mapped to Java.
_____: One goal of creating a system sequence diagram is to identify
				the public API of the software system.
_____: In practice, Fagan inspections are effective at finding bugs.

										 
										 
Question 2, max points = 40 (20+10+10)

You are designing a system that manages software development teams. 
You have identified two important groups of stakeholders: 
developers and testers.
(a) Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that contains a single 
class. This class will represent all stakeholders. Now add to the diagram
additional elements to represent developers and testers and the way they 
are related to the stakeholder class.















(b) Now convert your domain model to Java code. Outline the Java class 
or interface definitions in such a way that a developer may also be a 
tester and vice versa.















(c) Now do another Java code outline in which a developer cannot be a
tester and vice versa.
