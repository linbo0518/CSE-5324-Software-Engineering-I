Question 2, max points = 40 (10+10+10+10)

You are designing a system that manages a library. You have identified
the following kinds of library items: books, periodicals, and movies.

(a) Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that contains a single 
type. This type will represent all library items. Now add to the diagram
additional elements to represent books, periodicals, and movies
and the way they are related to the item type. Enforce in your class 
diagram that each item is either a book, a periodical, or a movie.










(b) Now convert your domain model to Java code skeletons.










(c) A few days later you realize that your library will also have to
manage items that do not fit your three kinds. You plan to make a single
change to your UML class diagram to allow for any such items.
Draw an updated version of your UML class diagram.










(d) Convert your updated domain model to Java code skeletons.
