true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
			software design because it includes all the information that is
			contained in the dynamic design models.
____: A box in a sequence diagram typically represents an object.
____: A guard in a sequence diagram prevents the guarded method call 
			from occurring under any circumstances.
____: Designing for visibility means that it is best to make methods
			public.
____: An advantage of UML communication diagrams over UML sequence
			diagrams is that they are more compact.
____: Guards in communication diagrams are stronger than guards in 
			sequence diagrams.
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be represented in a
			design class diagram.
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in code.
____: Each function is a relation.
____: Each relation is a function.
____: In an object-oriented program, an instance field can be understood as
			a map (a mathematical function) from field values to instances.
____: Calls to a static method cannot be shown in a UML sequence diagram.
____: Any UML sequence diagram is fully precise in the sense that all programs
			derived from the diagram will produce the same results for all inputs.
____: Any UML communication diagram is fully precise in the sense that all 
			programs derived from the diagram will produce the same results for all 
			inputs.
____: Frequent use of the instanceof operator is an indicator for an object-
			oriented design of a high quality.



			
			
			
Question 2, max points = 40

Draw a UML communication diagram that involves the following:
- One call to a method named a.
- One call to a method named b.
- One call to a method named c.
Design the diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two different
Java implementations of the methods a, b, and c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.













Give an outline of the two different implementations in Java.













Now draw a new UML communication diagram that is similar to the previous one,
except that the new diagram has additional elements to clarify that b calls c.
