Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

public class C 					 { 	public int foo(C p) { return 1; } }
public class D extends C { 	public int foo(D p) { return 2; }
														public int foo(E p) { return 3; } }
public class E extends D { 	public int foo(E p) { return 4; }	}
class X { C c = new C(); C d = new D(); C e = new E(); }
_____: d.foo(c) == 1
_____: d.foo(d) == 2
_____: d.foo(e) == 3
_____: e.foo(d) == 3
_____: e.foo(e) == 4

_____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
				software design because it includes all the information that is
				contained in the dynamic design models.	
_____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.			
_____: A relation that is not a function cannot be represented in a
				design class diagram.
_____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in code.
_____: Sub-contracting in Design by Contract means that a sub-contractor
				may place additional requirements on the client.
_____: The main goal of the project inception phase is to create a use-case
				diagram.
_____: We can easily prove that a requirements document is sound and complete
				with respect to the wishes of the user.	
_____: Each use-case consists of one success scenario and one 
				failure scenario.
_____: If versions v1 and v2 of a project only differ in the code of method
				E.z, E is a subclass of D, D.f contains a method call "z()", 
				C.m calls D.f as in m(D d) { /*..*/ x = d.f(); /*..*/ }, and 
				all methods are virtual (non-static, non-private, non-abstract), 
				then the execution behavior of C.m may differ between v1 and v2.
_____: In object-oriented languages, method overriding is resolved by the
				compiler.
_____: In Java, method overriding is resolved before method overloading.
_____: If class B extends class A, then, in the sense of method overloading,
				method foo(A,B,B) is more specific than method foo(B,A,A).
_____: If class B extends class A, then, in the sense of method overloading,
				method foo(A,B,int) is more specific than method foo(A,A,int).
_____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense 
				for a language to allow co-variant type change for method parameters.
_____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense 
				for a language to allow co-variant type change for method return types.


				
Question 2, max points = 40

This is an open-ended question. Provide as much information as you
can within the time limit. Pick one use-case of your team project and
develop it here.
