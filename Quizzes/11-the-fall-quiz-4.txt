			for the called method and an assumption for the caller.
____: Sub-contracting in Design by Contract allows a sub-contractor to place
			additional requirements on the client.
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense
			for a language to allow co-variant type change for method parameters.
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense
			for a language to allow co-variant type change for method return values.
____: In Java, method overriding is fully resolved by the compiler, the runtime

public class D extends C { 	public int foo(D p) { return 2; } }
public class E extends D { 	public int foo(E p) { return 3; } }
/* .. */ 
  C c = new C(); C d = new D(); C e = new E();
  D f = new D(); D g = new E(); E h = new E();
____ == d.foo(c)
