Example Question: True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1: True or false? (max points = 15 * 4 = 60)

____: A software engineering best practice is using a source control system, 
			such as Git, Hg, or Subversion.
____: Joel's hallway usability testing (of the "Joel Test") requires a hallway.
____: According to the Joel Test, a good way to reduce a programmer's 
			productivity is to frequently interrupt the programmer during 
			programming.
____: Dealing with requirement changes is on average easier with iterative 
			software development than it is with waterfall-style software development.
____: Dealing with an unexpected departure of a team member is on average 
			easier with iterative software development than it is with waterfall-style 
			software development.
____: In iterative software development, "time-boxed" iterations mean that 
			management frequently shortens the duration of individual iterations, 
			while increasing the duration of other iterations, to respond to project 
			needs.
____: Different stakeholders may have viewpoints that conflict with each other.
____: A best practice for making it easy to check if a software system S meets 
			a given requirement R is to quantify R.
____: Assume requirement R1 is "S has to respond immediately" and requirement 
			R2 is "S has to respond within one hour". Checking if S satisfies R2 is 
			easier than checking if S satisfies R1.				
____: Some requirements, such as usability, are by their nature "hopeless" and
			therefore hard to achieve, as they cannot be made testable.
____: In the domain model notation we discussed in class, a relation (a line)
			can connect an entity (a box) with the box itself (a "self-loop").
____: An example domain model relation is entity X reporting entity Y.
____: Assume we are creating a student class registration system for schools. 
			Then we can include a "takes" relation between "students" and "classes" 
			(e.g., student X takes classes A, B, and C) in our domain model that we 
			design with the domain model notation discussed in class.
____: For the above system, a best practice discussed in class is modeling
			"students" as an attribute of "class".
____: For the above system, a best practice discussed in class is modeling
			"classes" as an attribute of "student".

			
			



Question 2, max points = 40

This is an open-ended question. Provide as much information as you can within 
the time limit. Pick one use-case of your team project and develop it here.
