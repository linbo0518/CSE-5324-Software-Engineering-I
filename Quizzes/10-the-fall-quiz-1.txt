Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

_____: The waterfall model is a classic software development process model.
_____: The waterfall model aims at producing code before all requirements 
				are fully analyzed.
_____: The waterfall model is often described as "iterative".
_____: A typical customer in software engineering is comfortable expressing
        requirements rigorously, e.g., in first-order logic.
_____: Iterative software development aims at fully analyzing 
				all requirements before writing code.
_____: It has been scientifically proven that, for small to medium projects, 
				iterative software development always leads to better results
				than the waterfall model.
_____: In large industrial software engineering, requirements are typically 
				fixed early on in the project and remain fixed.
_____: The main goal of the project inception phase is to create a use-case
				diagram.
_____: We can easily prove that a requirements document is sound and complete
				with respect to the wishes of the user.
_____: Using the sound/complete classification, if the user wishes A, B, C,
				a specification that contains A, C is sound.
_____: Using the sound/complete classification, if the user wishes A, B, C,
				a specification that contains A, B, C, D is complete.
_____: Using the sound/complete classification, if the user wishes A, B, C,
				a specification that contains A, B, C, D is sound.				
_____: Each use-case consists of one success scenario and one 
				failure scenario.
_____: A use-case model often contains more information than the
				corresponding use-case diagram.
_____: A use-case diagram often contains more information than the
				corresponding use-case model.
_____: Domain models can be explained in terms of sets, relations, and 
				constraints on sets and relations.
_____: A domain model can only be expressed with UML class diagrams.
_____: Each class in a class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.
_____: The name of a conceptual class should be a noun phrase.
_____: Each successful software development project in industry uses UML.
