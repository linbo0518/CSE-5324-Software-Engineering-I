Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.
			
				
Question 1, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

public class C 					 { 	public int foo(C p) { return 1; } }
public class D extends C { 	public int foo(D p) { return 2; }
														public int foo(E p) { return 3; } }
public class E extends D { 	public int foo(C p) { return 4; }	}
class X { /*..*/ C c = new C(); C d = new D(); C e = new E(); }

____: d.foo(c) == 1
____: d.foo(d) == 2
____: d.foo(e) == 3
____: e.foo(d) == 3
____: e.foo(e) == 4
____: Method overloading can only be resolved at program runtime.
____: In method overloading, foo(E) is more specific than foo(C).
____: In method overloading, foo(C,int) is more specific than foo(C).
____: If each class in an object-oriented application has high cohesion, then
			coupling between classes is zero.
____: To support Design By Contract and sub-contracting, it would make sense 
			for a language to allow co-variant type change for method return types.
			
			
			



			

			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
Question 2, max points = 15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 50

Assume you have just implemented the below class A in an object-oriented 
programming language.

public class A {
  /* .. */
	public int foo(int p) { /* .. */ }
}

(a) In the sense of Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract you plan to use class A
as a contractor. You also plan to create a sub-contractor of class A, i.e., 
class B. Give the outline of class B below, in the style used for class A above.
Clearly state the programming language you are designing your code for. If
necessary for your language choice, you may make changes to class A above. Just
document these changes clearly.







(b) Assume the contract of A.foo is that it is designed to accept p values
that are larger than 10 and for such values will return non-negative values.
Sketch a contract for A.foo in terms of Design by Contract that expresses this.









(c) You plan to make sure that your class B is a good sub-contractor. Express 
below which rules class B has to satisfy to be a good sub-contractor in terms 
of Design by Contract.







(d) Give an example contract for class B.foo that ensures that class B is 
indeed a good sub-contractor.
