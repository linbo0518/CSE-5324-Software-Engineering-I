Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 10 * 5 = 50

True or false?

_____: The goal of creating a domain model is to eventually map each set
				of the domain model to a UI implementation class.
_____: In GRASP, the Information Expert pattern means that a program 
				specification should only be written by domain experts.
_____: In GRASP, the Creator pattern says that every class X should have its
				own dedicated factory class called XFactory.
_____: A project is optimal with regards to coupling if it has zero coupling.
_____: If versions v1 and v2 of a project only differ in the code of method 
				E.z, E is a subclass of D, D.f contains a method call "z()", C.m calls 
				D.f as in m(D d) { /*..*/ x = d.f(); /*..*/ }, and all methods are 
				virtual (non-static, non-private, non-abstract), then the execution 
				behavior of C.m may differ between v1 and v2.
_____: A best practice in writing Java programs is to avoid using 
				"instanceof".
_____: A best practice in writing programs is to place each database query 
				into the domain model class that is the most closely related to the 
				query.
_____: In object-oriented programming, interfaces can be used for information
				hiding.
_____: An instance field "A a" in class E may map an instance of E to at most
				one instance of A.
_____: An instance field can store a relation.
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
Question 2, max points = 20 + 10 + 20 = 50

Draw a UML communication diagram that contains a single object. The type
of the object is X and the name of the object is x. In addition to the x
object, add elements to represent the following three items.
(1) One call to method a, which has the signature "void a()".
(2) One call to method b, which has the signature "void b()".
(3) One call to method c, which has the signature "void c()".

Design the communication diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two 
different Java implementations of the methods a, b, and c. That is, the 
implementations should differ in who calls c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.













Give an outline of the two different implementations in Java.













Now draw a new UML communication diagram that is similar to the previous one,
except that the new diagram has additional elements to clarify that b calls c.
