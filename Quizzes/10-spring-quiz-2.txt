Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

_____: Each class in a UML class diagram represents a class in an
				object-oriented program.
_____: Each class in a UML class diagram is represented with a circle.				
_____: An operation contract defines the pre- and post-conditions of a
				step in a use-case scenario.
_____: Operation contracts are part of the design (they are not part
				of the requirements).
_____: Operation contracts are not directly related to the domain model.
_____: Operation contracts must be expressed in first-order logic.
_____: UML packages can only be used in UML package diagrams.
_____: Simple names are globally unique.
_____: Name-spaces are typically organized in a tree-structure.
_____: Name-spaces allow one to reuse the same simple name for 
				different elements.
_____: The design class diagram is considered a static design model.				
_____: In UML sequence diagrams, a method return value can be visualized
				with an arrow, but the arrow is optional.
_____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
				software design because it includes all the information that is
				contained in the dynamic design models.
_____: A box in a sequence diagram typically represents an object.
_____: A guard in a sequence diagram prevents the guarded method call 
				from occurring under any circumstances.
_____: Designing for visibility means that it is best to make methods
				public.
_____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
				items as the corresponding box in a domain model.
_____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
				items as the corresponding box in a sequence diagram.
_____: An advantage of UML communication diagrams over UML sequence
				diagrams is that they are more compact.
_____: Guards in communication diagrams have a different function
				than guards in sequence diagrams.


Question 2, max points = 30

You are designing a system that manages sports teams. You have identified
two important groups of stakeholders: owners and players. Draw a domain 
model as a UML class diagram that contains a class that represents all 
stakeholders. Then add to the diagram additional elements to represent 
owners and players and the way they are related to the stakeholder class.




Now convert your domain model to Java code. I.e., outline the Java class 
or interface definitions that ensure that an owner cannot be a player
and vice versa.





Now do another Java code outline, in which a player may also be an owner.





Question 3, max points = 10

Draw a UML sequence diagram that involves the following:
- One call to a method named c.
- An arbitrary number of calls to method a.
- An arbitrary number of calls to method b.
Design the diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two different
implementations of a, b, and c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c, but b does not call c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c, but a does not call c.
Also give an outline of the two different implementations.
