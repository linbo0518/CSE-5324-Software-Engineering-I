Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 45

True or false?

____: Operation contracts are not directly related to the domain model.
____: Name-spaces are typically organized in a tree-structure.
____: Name-spaces allow one to reuse the same simple name for 
			different elements.
____: A popular architecture consists of multiple layers, among them is a
			UI layer and an application logic layer.
____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
			items as the corresponding box in a domain model.
____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
			items as the corresponding box in a sequence diagram.
____: Guards in communication diagrams are stronger than guards in 
			sequence diagrams.
____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
			software design because it includes all the information that is
			contained in the dynamic design models.	
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be represented in a
			design class diagram.
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in code.
____: In Software Engineering, the terms "relation" and "function" are 
			synonyms.
____: If set I contains elements a, b, c, then the following is a 
			(mathematical) binary function on I: {(a,b), (a,c), (b,c)}.
____: In an object-oriented program, an instance field can be understood as
			a map (a mathematical function) from instance values to field values.
____: If in the domain model each element of conceptual class A is related
			with n elements of conceptual class B, and each element of B with
			one element of A, then we can express this in Java code as 
			"class A {B b;}".
____: If in the domain model each element of conceptual class A is related
			with n elements of conceptual class B, and each element of B with
			one element of A, then we can express this in Java code as 
			"class B {A a;}".				


Question 2, max points = 30

You are designing a system that manages college courses. You have identified
two important concepts: students and courses. We also know that each student 
takes up to 6 courses and each course is taken by at least 10 students.
Draw a domain model as a UML class diagram that represents these two 
concepts and the "takes" relation between them. 





Now convert the domain model into a design class diagram. Take into account
that, in the code, we will need to navigate from a course to the 
participating students, but not the other way around.





Now convert the design class diagram into Java classes. You may limit
your answer to a minimal outline that just represents the concepts 
discussed above.







Question 3, max points = 25

Draw a UML sequence diagram that involves the following:
- One call to a method named a.
- One call to a method named b.
- One call to a method named c.
Design the diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two different
Java implementations of the methods a, b, and c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.








Give an outline of the two different implementations.
