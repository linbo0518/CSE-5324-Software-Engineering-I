Example Question

True or false?

true: You may use a cheat sheet that you have written yourself.
true: You may not use any other sources.


Question 1, max points = 15 * 4 = 60

True or false?

____: An operation contract can be added to each step of a system 
			sequence diagram.
____: Operation contracts can be used to describe state changes in the
			domain model sets and relations.
____: The fact that a domain model relation does not contain a certain
			tuple is a valid operation contract post-condition.
____: The fact that a domain model relation does not contain a certain
			tuple is a valid operation contract pre-condition.			
____: The fact that a constraint that was in the original domain model 
			has now been removed from the domain model is a valid operation 
			contract post-condition.
____: Name-spaces are typically organized in a tree-structure.
____: Name-spaces allow one to reuse the same simple name for 
			different elements.
____: Information hiding means that we should hide numerical values
			by storing them as strings.
____: The best way to hide information in a program is to use
			aspect-oriented programming.
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in Java.
____: A 1:1 relation in the domain model may be implemented in code
			as an instance field.
____: A box in a communication diagram represents the same amount of
			items as the corresponding box in a domain model.
____: The class diagram is the most important element of a software 
			design as it includes all the information that is contained in 
			the dynamic design models.	
____: A relation that is not a function cannot be represented in a
			design class diagram.
____: In an object-oriented program, an instance field can be understood as
			a map (a mathematical function) from field values to instance values.




Question 2, max points = 40

Draw a single UML sequence diagram that involves the following:
- One call to a method named a.
- One call to a method named b.
- One call to a method named c.
Method a is defined by class C1, method c is defined by class C2.
Class C1 is not a subtype of C2; C2 is not a subtype of C1.
Design the diagram in such a way that it can be mapped to two different
Java implementations of the methods a, b, and c:
- In the first implementation, a calls c.
- In the second implementation, b calls c.














Give an outline of the two different implementations. I.e., show the
Java code outline of the involved classes and methods.
