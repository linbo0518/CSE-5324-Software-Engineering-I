Question 1, max points = 60

True or false?

_____: The design class diagram is considered a static design model.
_____: The design class diagram is the most important element of a 
				software design because it includes all the information that is
				contained in the dynamic design models.	
_____: If in the domain model each element of conceptual class A is related
				with n elements of conceptual class B, and each element of B with
				one element of A, then we can express this in Java code as 
				"class A {B b;}".
_____: If in the domain model each element of conceptual class A is related
				with n elements of conceptual class B, and each element of B with
				one element of A, then we can express this in Java code as 
				"class B {A a;}".				
_____: A relation that is not a function cannot be represented in a
				design class diagram.
_____: In Mathematics, the terms "relation" and "function" are synonyms.
_____: In Software Engineering, the terms "relation" and "function" are 
				synonyms.
_____: A relation that is not a function cannot be implemented in code.
_____: If versions v0 and v1 of a project only differ in the code of 
				method D.f, D is the superclass of E, method E.k contains a method 
				call "f()", method E.k is called by method A.h, and all methods 
				are virtual (non-static, non-private, non-abstract), then the 
				execution behavior of A.h may differ between v0 and v1.
_____: The design of most Java applications could be improved by relying 
				less on dynamic dispatch and more on the instanceof keyword.
_____: If versions v1 and v2 of a project only differ in the code of method
				E.z, E is a subclass of D, D.f contains a method call "z()", 
				C.m calls D.f as in m(D d) { /*..*/ x = d.f(); /*..*/ }, and 
				all methods are virtual (non-static, non-private, non-abstract), 
				then the execution behavior of C.m may differ between v1 and v2.
_____: The design of most Java applications could be improved by relying 
				less on dynamic dispatch and more on Java reflection.
_____: The UML concept of "realization" is unrelated to the UML concept
				of "generalization"				
_____: The core message of Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract is that
				you should not start the design before the client has paid the 
				fee defined in the contract.
_____: Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract concepts are only useful for
				people who code in his Eiffel programming language.
_____: Sub-contracting in Design by Contract means that a sub-contractor
				may place additional requirements on the client.
_____: Sub-contracting in Design by Contract means that a client
				may place additional requirements on the sub-contractor.
_____: Sub-contracting in Design by Contract means that a client
				may place additional requirements on the original contractor.				
_____: Method overriding can be explained as sub-contracting.
_____: Method overloading is best explained as sub-contracting.


Question 2, max points = 20

In the sense of Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract, the following class B
may act as a sub-contractor of class A. If B is a bad sub-contractor of A, 
B may break a contract of A. Describe two separate ways how B may break a 
contract of A. Phrase your explanation in terms of foo's pre- and 
post-conditions. Hint: First fix a concrete contract for A.foo, e.g.:
  precondition: p>0
  postcondition: the method return value is positive

public class A {
	public int foo(int p) {..}
}

public class B extends A {
	public int foo(int p) {..}
}
